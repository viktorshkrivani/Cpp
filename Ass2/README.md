# 🔢 Assignment: Numbers to Words / Odd–Even

## Objective
Write a C++ program that reads **two integers** (each on its own line) and, for every integer `n` in the inclusive range **[a, b]**, prints:

- If **1 ≤ n ≤ 9** → the lowercase English word (`one` … `nine`)
- If **n > 9** and `n` is even → `even`
- If **n > 9** and `n` is odd  → `odd`

Assume `a ≤ b`.
